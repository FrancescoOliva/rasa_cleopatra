The hypothesis that Publio Confuleio, in addition to the sale, was also involved in the processing of the sagum, is suggested by the presence of the rectangular basin and the circular well in one of the two rooms. From the inscription emerges the pride of a freedman who wanted to leave his mark, to anyone who entered the domus, of his social ascent: a man who from slave to freedman built his house from the foundations to the top, also paying attention to the care of the environments dedicated to work."

If you wanted to, you would go to the laconicum behind the sauna. After a while we returned to the tepidarium and then finished the wellness program in the frigidarium, that is, in an environment where we immersed ourselves in a cool tub to tone the skin and regain energy."

In the frigidarium you can observe a portion of mosaic with white tiles while in the cubiculum a mosaic floor that has a geometric decoration in black and white that recalls floral motifs. In the triclinium there is a floor in opus sectile with a geometric design. The marbles used, African yellow, pavonazzetto, red cipollino, create suggestive plays of color and the accuracy of the installation further enhances their richness and uniqueness. This type of floor, in terms of technique and materials, has been traced back to late antiquity, when the domus underwent renovations and redecorations (4th century a.D.)."

It contained three beds, each for three people, on which guests reclined for meals and conversation. Curved wall; part of the walls had to crown a room equipped with heating. It is executed in mixed work, which alternates rows of terracotta bricks and rows of stones. The wall can be dated between the third and fourth centuries. A.D., therefore to the late empire in which curved surfaces were preferred to flat ones. The room had two floors spaced apart with small columns made of terracotta and stone discs. The criterion was adopted for the propagation of hot air. Neglect, in the following decades, lost most of the records."

    text: "The most important restoration was that carried out by the Bourbons in the mid-nineteenth century due to the state of decay and the numerous lacerations that compromised the statics. In a first restoration project it was proposed that the works (shoring interventions and generalized compensation) be carried out paying attention to the differentiation of techniques, so as to be able to recognize “the old from the new”. Subsequently, however, due to the deterioration of the conditions of the structure, a more radical intervention was proposed in a second project aimed at a complete re-wrapping of the brick construction. In addition, it was indicated to put in place a covering in broad bricks in the upper part to ensure greater protection from atmospheric agents. The proposed works, known thanks to archival documentation, are recognizable in the conditions of the arch as it appears today. Over time, however, the monument has received further restoration works. Another restoration took place in the years following 1883 to remedy the damage caused by the battle of the Volturno in 1860 while other interventions were carried out between 1945 and 1953-55 following the events of World War II. On that occasion, various infill walls were carried out, demolition of part of the previous restorations and a partial reconstruction of the surviving vault; these restorations also involved the re-wrapping of the plinths in polygonal tuff blocks. A last restoration, carried out in the seventies, helped to flatten the top of the surviving arch on the side pillars."

The restoration, carried out with great care, is evident above all in the shooting of the uncertain work, which closes the guttings and integrates the shortcomings, reshapes the frames and covers the top with a new cap. Another restoration was carried out between the 1950s and 60s of the twentieth century, where the photographic documentation from 1957 highlights the shortcomings in some points of the walls that appear, however, compensated for in images from 1962."

The pillars rest on an enlarged base made of parallelepiped blocks in white limestone and are distinguished by slender elongated and arched niches. Of considerable interest for the study of the original form of the arch are the drawings depicting it between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which can, at times, help to provide details, of which otherwise would not be known. Over time, various artists and travelers have depicted the monument as it appeared to their eyes, sometimes in a more picturesque and suggestive way, others more realistic.

Above it rises a cylindrical body, always slender, characterized by a slightly wider smooth base and by a tambour with semi-columns comprising flat niches, covered in arches; a small dome crowns the top. The burial chamber can be accessed via an entrance that restores the old one, on the front of the ancient Via Appia. The room, preceded by a small entrance, is quadrangular in shape with walls that house three niches on each side, except for the entrance that houses two, one on each side of the door. The sepulcher probably did not look directly onto the ancient road, but must have been preceded by a funerary enclosure, the remains of which could be preserved under the current roadway of the road. Thanks to its architectural form and location along the Via Appia, the Conocchia attracted the attention of artists and travelers as early as the sixteenth century and especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the sixteenth century a drawing by Pirro Ligorio seems to propose the representation of this ancient sepulcher. Among the various drawings, that of Carlo Labruzzi, executed in 1789 during his journey along the Appian Way, is of particular documentary interest."

In the early 1600s, a convent was erected in correspondence with an arm of the cryptoporticus, with an adjoining chapel, dedicated to San Francesco di Paola. In 1700 stables were installed there to house a regiment of the royal cavalry. The cryptoporticus is depicted in a drawing by Carlo Labruzzi from the end of the eighteenth century. The convent, destroyed by an earthquake and a fire, was suppressed in 1810 and with it also the part reserved for the stables. Between the beginning and the mid-1800s, the transformation into a prison took place, which constitutes the most incisive and striking phase of the restructuring of the complex. The building was the most important central prison in Terra di Lavoro until its disposal in the late 1900s, when the complex became the seat of the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the Second University of Naples until 2016."

The drawing shows a non-ancient entrance in the foreground, made by obliterating reticulated opus structures on the left and brickwork on the right, where the ferrule of an arch also in brick buffered in non-ancient blocks is also outlined. One of the arms is highlighted, illuminated by windows on the right side only, with the headboard on the bottom. The only perplexity regarding Labruzzi's design: the absence of mangers in the cryptoporticus, pertinent to the chivalry of the eighteenth century, however, if we want to give credit to the artist, they must be considered made during the nineteenth century."

    text: "Carried out in 1789 during his journey along the Appian Way, the drawing by Carlo Labruzzi is of particular documentary interest as it takes up the tomb at a time prior to the Bourbon restoration. The artist's care lies in the documentation of the monument as it appeared and in the choice of the frame that would be able to highlight the construction features. The double frame is depicted on the top of the columns of the second parallelepiped; the ovoli frame under the notched frame of the base nut; the base of the half-columns of the upper drum and the double frame with intermediate cavity on the top of the same drum. All these details are not found in the current configuration of the monument."

The artist's care lies in the documentation of the monument as it appeared and in the choice of the frame that would be able to highlight the construction features. Labruzzi's drawing shows a large preserved portion of ambulatory in brick work, probably with a double order, leaning against a two-storey house which, due to its semicircular shape, was supposed to insist on and incorporate other remains of the monument."

The battle of the Volturno indicates some armed clashes that took place between the Garibaldi volunteers and the Bourbon troops, which took place between 26 September and 2 October 1860 near the Volturno river, during the expedition of the Thousand. The territory involved in the war is located in the current province of Caserta, roughly delimited in a triangle having the vertices in the cities of Capua, Caiazzo and Maddaloni."

In the early 1600s, a convent was erected in correspondence with an arm of the cryptoporticus, with an adjoining chapel, dedicated to San Francesco di Paola. In 1700 stables were installed there to house a regiment of the royal cavalry. The convent, destroyed by an earthquake and a fire, was suppressed in 1810 and with it also the part reserved for the stables. Between the beginning and the mid-1800s, the transformation into a prison took place, which constitutes the most incisive and striking phase of the restructuring of the complex. The building was the most important central prison in Terra di Lavoro until its disposal in the late 1900s, when the complex became the seat of the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the Second University of Naples until 2016."

The external structure had 4 floors with a total height of 46 meters, all of Tuscan order. The three lower floors consisted of 80 arches each of travertine and the arch keys were adorned with busts of divinities, seven of these are visible on the facade of the Municipal Palace of Capua, others are exhibited in the city museum. Some remains are visible in the Campano Museum of the city of Capua and in the Archaeological Museum of the ancient Capua di Santa Maria Capua Vetere.
